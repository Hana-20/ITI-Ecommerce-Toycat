This project is a professional-grade E-commerce web application built using the latest Jakarta EE 17 technologies. The application leverages the power of Jakarta Servlet and Jakarta Persistence to provide a highly scalable, efficient and user-friendly platform for an online toy store.

One of the key features of this E-commerce project is its robust Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which enables clear separation of concerns between the business logic, presentation layer and data access components. This ensures high maintainability, flexibility and testability of the application, allowing for easy customization and adaptation to changing business requirements.

With this web application, customers can easily browse through a wide variety of toys, search for specific items using different criteria, and make purchases securely and conveniently from the comfort of their own homes. The application also includes advanced features such as real-time inventory management, order tracking, and a comprehensive customer support system, all of which are designed to enhance the overall user experience and increase customer satisfaction.
